## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Firebase Configuration Unified**

- Built comprehensive `StatisticsEditor` component with:
  - Real-time editing of statistics
  - Save individual statistics
  - Initialize default statistics
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Success/error notifications

### 2. **Admin Statistics Editor**
- Accessible from the Admin Console
- Edit both labels and values for each statistic
- Save changes to Firebase in real-time
- Initialize default statistics if needed
- Success/error feedback messages

### 3. **Firebase Integration**
- Secure Firestore database integration
